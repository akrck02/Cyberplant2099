# Conclusion

Hey there, I'm glad that you are still reading this, this project was so funny for me and I learn about Arduino, electronics and plants 🤖💡🌱. 

I decided to share this with you so that you can also create wonderful things. I think this is what makes coding special, doesn't matter who you are or where you live, the only real thing is what you build and how you learn about it 💻💖.

I really appreciate the experiences that coding has given me the last 4 years and hope that new people can experience the magic of creating things. that's why I love and support the open source community and I'm proud to be part of it. 💙

If you like this type of things, make sure to check out my other projects, contribute if you want and give it a try. 🧪🔬

Thank you again for reading this, I will keep working on open and free source code many years! 📆⌨️
