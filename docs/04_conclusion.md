# Conclusion

Hey there, I'm glad that you are still reading this, this project was so funny for me and I learn about Arduino, electronics and plants. 

I decided to share with you so you can build amazing things to. I think this is what makes coding special, doesn't matter who you are or where you live, the only real thing is what you build and how you learn about it.

I really appreciate the experiences that coding give me the last 4 years and I hope that new people can experience the magic of creating things, that's why I love and support the open source community and I'm proud to be part of it.

If you like this type of things, make sure to check out my other projects, conmtribute if you want and give it a try.

Thank you again for reading this, I will keep working on open and free source code many years!
