# The Cyberplant concept

Hi there, this project is the first bossfight of the [ArduinoJourney series](https://github.com/akrck02/ArduinoJourney), creating an automatic plant based on Arduino, capable of watering itself and logging status via Serial communication. 🌱💻

I decided to call it **Cyberplant** 😎
